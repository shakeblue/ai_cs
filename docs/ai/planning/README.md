# Project Planning & Task Breakdown

## Task Breakdown
**What are the specific tasks to complete?**

- List all tasks and subtasks
- Organize by implementation order
- Include testing and documentation tasks

## Dependencies
**What needs to happen first?**

- Task dependencies
- External dependencies (APIs, libraries, services)
- Team dependencies

## Effort Estimation
**How complex is each task?**

- Complexity rating (Low/Medium/High)
- Estimated time (if applicable)
- Risk level

## Implementation Order
**In what sequence should we build this?**

- Recommended implementation phases
- Parallel vs sequential tasks
- Quick wins vs foundational work

## Risks & Mitigation
**What could go wrong?**

- Technical risks
- Integration risks
- Mitigation strategies
