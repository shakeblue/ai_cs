# Testing Strategy & Test Cases

## Testing Approach
**How will we test this feature?**

- Testing levels (unit, integration, E2E)
- Testing frameworks and tools
- Test data strategy

## Unit Test Cases
**What unit tests do we need?**

- Functions/methods to test
- Test scenarios for each
- Edge cases and error conditions
- Expected code coverage target

## Integration Test Cases
**How do components work together?**

- Integration scenarios
- API endpoint tests
- Database interaction tests
- External service mocking

## Manual Testing Checklist
**What should be tested manually?**

- User workflows to verify
- UI/UX validation
- Browser/platform compatibility
- Performance testing

## Test Coverage
**What's our coverage status?**

- Current coverage percentage
- Uncovered code sections
- Coverage gaps to address

## Known Test Gaps
**What still needs testing?**

- Missing test cases
- Hard-to-test scenarios
- Future test improvements
