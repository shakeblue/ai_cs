currently in order to crawler live events and promotion I have to run script manually with lives url ((/home/long/ai_cs/crawler/cj/naver_broadcast_crawler.py, /home/long/ai_cs/crawler/cj/run_livebridge_crawler.py)). Now we should schedule to crawler on configured platforms (/home/long/ai_cs/backend/crawler/config/platforms.json) to fetch data for configured brands (/home/long/ai_cs/backend/crawler/config/brands.json). Admin can manage platform,brands on admin with live url,status. The live search url for brand should like "https://shoppinglive.naver.com/search/lives?query=%EC%84%A4%ED%99%94%EC%88%98". We should crawler lives/replays events that has start date within a week, current ongoing, or plan in short future.
